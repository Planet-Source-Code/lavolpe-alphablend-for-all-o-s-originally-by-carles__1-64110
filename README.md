### Description

(Updated) Carles posted a very excellent alphablend &amp; stretch routine that did not rely on the AlphaBlend API. Original post is txtCodeId=60424. This is my spin on his code adding some functionality not previously available. Changes include blending non-32bit images, using clipping to speed up some stretched images, adding options to stretch portions of images, offering a global alpha blend option along with per pixel alphas. However, the added overhead can prove to be slightly slower than Carles' original routines. You should test &amp; compare against his original code. ALL VOTES SHOULD GO to his post (txtCodeId=60424). Modified 23Jan/22:30zulu to handle negative DC offsets &amp; fix known calculation errors. Tweaked 24Jan/1609z for speed. 26Jan/1700z: final safety checks added; minor speed improvements
